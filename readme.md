##Quickstart Guide

1. Start off by installing the latest stable version of Node.js.
2. Install *nodemon* with `npm install nodemon -g`. This is a simple daemon, which can be useful for development.
3. Clone this repository and run `npm install`, in the repository directory, to install all the necessary modules.
4. Run `nodemon app.js` to start the application. The application will automatically restart when changes are made to the files.

##Important

* All CSS (SASS) changes should be done in `/private/css`.
* Create a new SASS file if needed (new feature or function), in order to improve code clarity.
* All code should be as DRY as possible.
